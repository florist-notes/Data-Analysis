Scotch Whisky |
 
Scotch whisky is prized for its complexity and variety of flavors.
And the regions of Scotland where it is produced
are believed to have distinct flavor profiles.
In this case study, we will classify scotch whiskies
based on their flavor characteristics.
The dataset we'll be using contains a selection of scotch whiskies 
from several distilleries, and we'll attempt to cluster whiskies
 into groups that are similar in flavor.
This case study will deepen your understanding of Pandas, NumPy,
and scikit-learn, and perhaps of scotch whisky.


The dataset we'll be using consists of tasting ratings
 of one readily available single malt scotch whisky
from almost every active whisky distillery in Scotland.
The resulting dataset has 86 malt whiskies
that are scored between 0 and 4 in 12 different taste categories.
The scores have been aggregated from 10 different tasters.
The taste categories describe whether the whiskies are sweet, smoky,
medicinal, spicy, and so on.
