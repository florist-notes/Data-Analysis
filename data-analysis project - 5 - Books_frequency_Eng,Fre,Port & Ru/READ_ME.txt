Patterns within written text are not the same across all authors or languages.
This allows linguists to study the language of origin
or potential authorship of texts where these characteristics are not
directly known such as the Federalist Papers of the American Revolution.
In this case study, we will examine the properties of individual books 
in a book collection from various authors and various languages.
More specifically, we will look at book lengths, number of unique words,
and how these attributes cluster by language of or authorship.
Project Gutenberg is the oldest digital library of books.
It aims to digitize and archive cultural works, and at present,
contains over 50,000 books, all previously published
and now available electronically.
